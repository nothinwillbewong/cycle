This is the final ENDF/B-VIII.1 release for the *thermal neutron scattering law (TSL) sublibrary*. The full list of changes across multiple ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta releases, since ENDF/B-VIII.0, are listed in detail in the file CHANGELOG.md. A summarized list is also shown below.

The ENDF-6 files in this ENDF/B-VIII.1 release were successfully processed using NJOY-16.76 and FUDGE-6.7 for all sublibraries, and AMPX (SCALE-7.0b08) for neutrons and photo-atomic sublibraries.  Note: AMPX processing for the thermal neutron scattering sublibrary used features to be made available in a future SCALE-7.0 beta.

Complete and detailed information on the ENDF/B-VIII.1 release can be found in the accompanying article that will be submitted for publication in the Nuclear Data Sheets journal shortly after the ENDF/B-VIII.1 release.





History of ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta releases for the *hermal neutron scattering law (TSL) sublibrary*:
----

* VIII.1 final release (30 August, 2024): There were only very minor fixes or cosmetic changes to 81 ENDF-6 files plus a minor update to the TSL_MAT_numbers.csv file. Additionally, there were updates to the  metadata in file headers, which impacted all ENDF-6 files.

* VIII.1-Beta4 (28 June, 2024): Relative to the previous release (VIII.1-Beta3), there are 21 ENDF-6 files changed, either updated or added, in addition to associated files (LEAPR, README, FLASSH, etc.). The CSV file with unique identification of MAT numbers ('TSL_MAT_numbers.csv') was also updated to include assginments for new materials. Highlights in this release are updated evaluations for YH2 and special purpose evaluations for BeF2, MgF2, and MgO for filter applications. There were also many fixes done of different degrees of complexity.

* VIII.1-Beta3 (11 January, 2024): There are 99 ENDF-6 files changed, either updated or added, in addition to associated files (LEAPR, README, FLASSH, etc.) and the CSV file with unique identification of MAT numbers. Highlights are new unique MAT numbers, new enirchment files for fuel materials, new complete lucite evaluation, low-energy extrapolation for light water, criogenic para- and ortho-deuterium and hydrogen, new plutonium dioxide and zyrcomium carbide evaluations, and other fixes of different degrees of complexity. 

* VIII.1-Beta2 (4 August, 2023):  10 updated ENDF-6 files, including a new polystyrene evaluation and documentation and additional fixes.

* VIII.1-Beta1.1 (18 April, 2023): First Beta release for TNSL with files having gone through a review process. Many (64) files updated or added relative to ENDF/B-VIII.0, corresponding to contributions mostly from NCSU, NNL, ORNL.

* VIII.1-Beta1 (1 March 2023): Not part of the release, as there were no updates from VIII.0.
