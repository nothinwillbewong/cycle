This evaluation was generated by Naval Nuclear Laboratory [1] using FLASSH [2].  The physical model is based on a generalized elastic scattering treatment and includes coherent elastic scattering and inelastic scattering components at 10 temperatures.  The evaluation is intended to be used with the companion C(Be2C) TSL evaluation when modeling beryllium carbide. /HISTORYSECTION
==
Beryllium carbide (Be2C) has a cubic anti-fluorite (CaF2) crystallographic structure (Fm3m space group) with four molecules per unit cell [3].  The coherent elastic scattering cross sections were evaluated in the cubic approximation using the FLASSH generalized elastic scattering treatment based on the Be2C unit cell crystal structure [3], the measured room temperate unit cell lattice parameter of 4.3420 Ang from [4] and the Be and C free atom scattering cross sections from ENDF/B-VIII.0.  The inelastic scattering cross sections were evaluated in the incoherent approximation using the Be and C phonon density of states from a first-principles VASP/PHONON calculation [1] using a 3x3x3 supercell, a phonon order of 400, and LO/TO splitting to better capture the higher energy vibrational modes. /THEORYSECTION
