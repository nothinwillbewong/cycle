This evaluation was generated by Naval Nuclear Laboratory (Mar 2023) [1] using the FLASSH code [2].  The physical model is based on a mixed elastic scattering treatment and includes coherent elastic scattering, incoherent elastic scattering and inelastic scattering components.  This evaluation is intended to be used with the companion 7Li(7LiD) TSL evaluation when modeling enriched 7LiD. /HISTORYSECTION

Lithium hydride (LiD) has a fluorite (NaCl) type face-centered cubic crystal structure with four Li and D atoms per unit call.  The inelastic scattering cross sections were calculated in the incoherent approximations using the D partial phonon density of states from a VASP/PHONON calculation of 7LiD.  The LiD crystal structure and lattice constant from [3] were used in the VASP/PHONON calculation.  The mixed elastic scattering treatment was used to account for both coherent and incoherent elastic scattering effects present in this material.  The coherent elastic scattering component was calculated in the cubic approximation using the FLASSH generalized coherent elastic scattering module using the 7LiD crystal structure and measured room temperature lattice constant of 4.0684 Ang [3] along with free atom coherent scattering cross sections of 2.483 b for D from [4] and 0.51 b for Li-7 from [5]. The incoherent elastic scattering component was calculated using the Debye-Waller factor derived from the D partial phonon density of states and an D free atom incoherent scattering cross section of 0.912 b.  A D free atom total scattering cross section of 3.395 b was used for consistency with the ENDF/B-VIII.1 D evaluation. A phonon order of 500 was used to ensure both the inelastic scattering cross section and the S(alpha,beta) functions at elevated temperatures were adaquately converged. /THEORYSECTION
