This evaluation was generated by Naval Nuclear Laboratory (Mar 2023) [1] using the FLASSH code [2].  The physical model is based on a mixed elastic scattering treatment and includes coherent elastic scattering, incoherent elastic scattering and inelastic scattering components.  This evaluation is intended to be used with the companion 7Li(7LiH) TSL evaluation when modeling enriched 7LiH. /HISTORYSECTION

Lithium hydride (LiH) has a fluorite (NaCl) type face-centered cubic crystal structure with four Li and H atoms per unit call.  The inelastic scattering cross sections were calculated in the incoherent approximations using the H partial phonon density of states from a VASP/PHONON calculation of 7LiH.  The LiH crystal structure and lattice constant from [3] were used in the VASP/PHONON calculation. The mixed elastic scattering treatment was used to account for both coherent and incoherent elastic scattering effects present in this material.  The coherent elastic scattering component was calculated in the cubic approximation using the FLASSH generalized coherent elastic scattering module using the 7LiH crystal structure and measured room temperature lattice parameter of 4.0831 Ang from [3] along with free atom coherent scattering cross sections of 0.439 b for H and 0.51 b for Li-7 from [4].  The incoherent elastic scattering component was calculated using the Debye-Waller factor derived from the H partial phonon density of states and an H free atom incoherent scattering cross section of 19.997 b.  A H free atom total scattering scattering cross section of 20.436 b was used to ensure consistency with the ENDF/B-VIII.1 H evaluation. A phonon order of 500 was used to ensure both the inelastic scattering cross section and the S(alpha,beta) functions at elevated temperatures were adaquately converged. /THEORYSECTION
