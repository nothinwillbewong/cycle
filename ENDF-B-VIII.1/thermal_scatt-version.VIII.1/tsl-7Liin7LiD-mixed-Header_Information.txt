This evaluation was generated by Naval Nuclear Laboratory (Mar 2023) [1] using the FLASSH code [2].  The physical model is based on the mixed elastic scattering treatment and includes coherent elastic scattering, incoherent elastic scattering and inelastic scattering contributions. This evaluation is intended to be used with the companion D(7LiD) TSL evaluation when modeling enriched 7LiD. /HISTORYSECTION

Lithium hydride (LiD) has a fluorite (NaCl) type face-centered cubic crystal structure with four Li and D atoms per unit call.  The inelastic scattering cross sections were calculated in the incoherent approximation using the Li-7 partial phonon density of states from a VASP/PHONON calculation of 7LiD based on the crystal structure and lattice constant from [3].  The mixed elastic scattering treatment was used to account for both coherent and incoherent elastic scattering effects present in this material.  The coherent elastic scattering component was calculated in the cubic approxiation using the FLASSH generalized coherent elastic scattering module using the 7LiD crystal structure and measured room temperature lattice constant of 4.0684 Ang [3] along with free atom coherent scattering cross sections of 0.51 b for Li-7 from [5] and 2.483 b for D from [4]. The incoherent elastic scattering component was calculated using the Debye-Waller factor derived from the Li-7 partial phonon density of states and a Li-7 free atom incoherent scattering cross section of 0.46 b from [5].  A Li-7 free atom total scattering cross section of 0.97 b was used to ensure consistency with the ENDF/B-VIII.1 Li-7 evaluation. A phonon order of 500 was used to ensure both the inelastic scattering cross section and the S(alpha,beta) functions at elevated temperatures were adaquately converged. /THEORYSECTION
