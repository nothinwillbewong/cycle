This is the final ENDF/B-VIII.1 release for the *photo-atomic sublibrary*. The full list of changes across multiple ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta releases, since ENDF/B-VIII.0, are listed in detail in the file CHANGELOG.md. A summarized list is also shown below.

Inconsistencies in the photo-atomic files between transition energies, which are derived quantities, and updated binding energies have been identified. Users are encouraged to rely on *binding energies*. This will be addressed in a future library release.

The ENDF-6 files in this ENDF/B-VIII.1 release were successfully processed using NJOY-16.76 and FUDGE-6.7 for all sublibraries, and AMPX (SCALE-7.0b08) for neutrons and photo-atomic sublibraries.  Note: AMPX processing for the thermal neutron scattering sublibrary used features to be made available in a future SCALE-7.0 beta.

Complete and detailed information on the ENDF/B-VIII.1 release can be found in the accompanying article that will be submitted for publication in the Nuclear Data Sheets journal shortly after the ENDF/B-VIII.1 release.
