This is the final ENDF/B-VIII.1 release for the *neutrons sublibrary*. The full list of changes across multiple ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta releases, since ENDF/B-VIII.0, are listed in detail in the file CHANGELOG.md. A summarized list is also shown below.

The ENDF-6 files in this ENDF/B-VIII.1 release were successfully processed using NJOY-16.76 and FUDGE-6.7 for all sublibraries, and AMPX (SCALE-7.0b08) for neutrons and photo-atomic sublibraries.  Note: AMPX processing for the thermal neutron scattering sublibrary used features to be made available in a future SCALE-7.0 beta.

Complete and detailed information on the ENDF/B-VIII.1 release can be found in the accompanying article that will be submitted for publication in the Nuclear Data Sheets journal shortly after the ENDF/B-VIII.1 release.



History of ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta releases for the *neutrons sublibrary*:
----

* VIII.1 final release (30 August, 2024): There were changes to the data content of 17 files. Most of these updates were only improvements in the documentation text, while others adressed small issues in the files (86Kr, 192Pt, 208Pb). None of these changes should impact any validation result from ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta4. Additionally, there were updates to the  metadata in file headers, which impacted all files.



* VIII.1-Beta4 (28 June, 2024): 29 files were updated, including covariances, new exit distributions for 3He, new resonance evaluations for 63,65Cu, reverted changes to 95Mo, and other important fixes to 207,208Pb.

* VIII.1-Beta3 (11 January, 2024): 121 files updated from ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta2, including improvements in 239Pu, 9Be, 52Cr, resonance evaluations for 51V, 88Sr, 233U, fast-region evaluations for 190-198Pt, added exit distributions from KAERI/LANL, prompt nubar evaluations and many other fixes and improvements.

* VIII.1-Beta2 (4 August, 2023):  275 files updated from ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta1.1. All files submitted to the neutrons sublibrary were incorporated into release. 

* VIII.1-Beta1.1 (18 April, 2023): After the release of Beta1, a few small but important errors were discovered. This Beta1.1 release aims to rectify that by updating four files. The goal of this release is to change minimally, if at all, ongoing criticality validation.

* VIII.1-Beta1 (1 March 2023): First Beta release with all files having gone through a review process. Many (263) files updated relative to ENDF/B-VIII.0, corresponding to INDEN and non-INDEN evaluations as well as minor and major fixes.
