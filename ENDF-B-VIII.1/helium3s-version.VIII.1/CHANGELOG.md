ENDF/B-VIII.1 final release (30 August, 2024)
---------------------------------------------

The only changes in data content for the 3He (helions) sublibrary since ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta4 are to 6Li (restored CP elastic scattering from VIII.0 evaluation that went missing due to a GNDS to ENDF translation issue) and to 7Li (added elastic scattering, Rutherford only, which went missing due to a GNDS to ENDF translation issue). The complete list of files with data content changes since ENDF/B-VIII.1-Beta4 can be seen below.
Additionally, **ALL** files had their metadata in the file headers updated to match the correct information for the final ENDF/B-VIII.1 release.
